ABOUT : 

In this task, we utilized a combination of Python libraries to fetch, process, and visualize data from a public API. The **Requests** library was used to send an HTTP GET request to the **COVID-19 API**, which provided real-time data on cases, deaths, and recoveries from countries worldwide. The response, returned in JSON format, was then parsed into a Python dictionary. We used **Pandas** to structure this data, filtering out the necessary fields like `country`, `cases`, `deaths`, and `recovered`, and organizing them into a DataFrame for easy manipulation. We also employed Pandas' sorting functionality to identify the top 10 countries by total cases, ensuring a focused analysis. For visualization, **Seaborn** was leveraged to create aesthetically pleasing bar plots, which were used to represent the data for cases, deaths, and recoveries across the top 10 countries. Finally, **Matplotlib** provided control over the layout, where we arranged the bar charts side by side using `subplots()` for better comparison, and `tight_layout()` ensured proper spacing and alignment of elements within the figure. The combination of these tools allowed for an efficient workflow to process and visualize the data, resulting in clear and informative visualizations.
